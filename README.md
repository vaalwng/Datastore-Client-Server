# Datastore-Client-Server
This project will involve constructing a client-server system that communicates over TCP/IP sockets. The server will store, retrieve, delete, &amp; list named data sets on the server. Each data set is associated with a string name provided in the clientâ€™s request to the server. The server is responsible for storing this data in a persistent fashion for later retrieval. Data is persistently stored in files in a directory under the project directory.
